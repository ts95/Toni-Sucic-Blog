	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		I am Toni Sučić and this is my blog. It will prominently feature topics
		revolving around programming, web development and computer science.
		I've been passionate about programming ever since I learned my first
		programming language, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>
		in 2011. Since then I have experimented with many different languages and frameworks.
